    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So we moved in with a few friends. A bunch of geeks just like me... fine move :) We call our house the "Geekarium". And of course, we play video games. Or more specifically, we play <a href="http://warthunder.com/">War Thunder</a>, a WW2 airplane simulation.</p>

<p>I like to pretend these planes are real, and the keyboard is not enough. Arduino to the rescue :)</p>

<h2>A bit of history</h2>

<p>The Supermarine Spitfire is probably one of the best known aircraft out there. A legend, dare I say.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/media/spitfire/spitfire_side_view.jpg" width="480" height="360" title="'A spitfire seen from its side'" ></p>

<p>Created a bit before WW2, the Spitfire was used along the Hurricane during the Battle of Britain, to successfully deflect german bombers.</p>

<p>It was fitted with a Merlin engine and beautiful elliptical wings, which made him very recognisable among the other airplanes.</p>

<p>Read more about this masterpiece of history on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarine_Spitfire">its wikipedia page</a>.</p>

<h2>So I started building this panel...</h2>

<p>So yes, I've fallen in love again with airplanes. So much that I actually decided to supplement my joystick with a custom control panel. You know, for all those things that usually remain on the keyboard: start engine, landing gear control, flaps etc.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/media/spitfire/arduino_spitfire.jpg" width="480" height="388" title="'The early arduino prototype'" ></p>

<p>No blueprints yet, only experimenting some stuff with my arduino. Roughly, what I came up with until now is a sketch that monitors one or more digital inputs, and reports on the serial port.</p>

<p>Also available on github: <a href="https://github.com/aspyct/spitfire">https://github.com/aspyct/spitfire</a>.</p>

<p>```c</p>

<h1>define INPUT_COUNT 2</h1>

<h1>define TIMEGUARD 100 // numper of milliseconds before a new input is taken into account</h1>

<p>int inputs[INPUT_COUNT] = {
  2,
  6
};</p>

<p>int states[INPUT_COUNT];</p>

<p>char keymap[INPUT_COUNT * 2] = {
  'd', 'g',
  '6', '\0'
};</p>

<p>unsigned long fired[INPUT_COUNT];</p>

<p>void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);</p>

<p>  for (int i = 0; i &lt; INPUT_COUNT; ++i) {</p>

<pre><code>pinMode(inputs[i], INPUT);
states[i] = readState(inputs[i]);
fired[i] = 0;
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  // Wait for serial connection to be established
  while (!Serial);
}</p>

<p>int readState(int pin) {
  return digitalRead(pin);
}</p>

<p>void loop() {
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; INPUT_COUNT; ++i) {</p>

<pre><code>unsigned long time = millis();

int pin = inputs[i];
int val = readState(pin);

if (val != states[i] &amp;&amp; time - fired[i] &gt; TIMEGUARD) {
  states[i] = val;
  fired[i] = time;

  char response = keymap[i * 2 + (val == HIGH)];
  if (response) {
    Serial.print(response);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
```</p>
