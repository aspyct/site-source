    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For this controller, I need a box. I want it to be classy, sober, and a bit old-school. The only real requirement is that it has to provide an easy access to electronics in case something goes wrong. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy's_law">Murphy's law</a>, you know...</p>

<p>Some of you may arrive out of the blue here. So have a look at the <a href="/blog/2013/07/15/spitfire-project-day-number-1/">previous article, day #1</a>.</p>

<p>So I tear apart my joystick box, cardboard stuff, and built a small control box with it. Or rather a prototype of that box to be.</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>

<p>With a few simple tools like swiss army knife, a set square, a pen and some tape, I started destroying one box and building the other :) This is the bottom that you can see here: (the tape roll ran away during the picture)</p>

<h2>Building the box</h2>

<p>Then I quickly added the top as well as some switches and LEDs. I think it looks nice already, I'm gonna love it!</p>

<p>After some fiddling around, I decided to go for a rear opening. With the cardboard, it works fine, but the wooden box will require hinges. And it's probably a bad idea to put hinges in front, I might well hurt myself on this...</p>

<p>With the sides, and the arduino inside for the show...</p>

<h2>Finished prototype</h2>

<p>So that's it. Not really impressive, eh? But this gives a good idea of the expected final shape, and it helped me think about some important stuff like hinge position, cable management etc. A few hours work, little to no cost for so many saved hours and material later :)</p>

<p>On top of it is the first list of the controls I want on this box. More on that later :)</p>
