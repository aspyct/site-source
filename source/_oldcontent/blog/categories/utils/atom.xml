    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I had to import about ~150 file entries into an XML file. Being a good lazy geek, I could not resign myself to copy/paste this over. With the help of Rake and some custom-tailored scripts, I made it through in no time :)</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>All these files had the same format:</p>

<p><code>
chapter1_slide1_fr.png
chapter1_slide2_fr.png
...
chapter1_slide19_fr.png
chapter2_slide1_fr.png
</code></p>

<p>Of course, when I tried to sort them with the <code>sort</code> command, it did not really work as expected... Because this is a lexicographical sort, and not the natural sort we would expect.</p>

<p><code>
chapter1_slide19_fr.png
chapter1_slide1_fr.png
</code></p>

<p>I needed a natural sort, just like the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.natsort.php">natsort() function from PHP</a>. Actually, I also needed a small program that would list the contents of a directory and print its naturally-sorted contents.</p>

<p>These scripts are available on <a href="https://github.com/aspyct/shutils">my github</a>. You can easily install them for your user by running the <code>shutil_install.sh</code> script. You may have to <code>chmod +x</code> the scripts however. Read more on these scripts on their <a href="/shutils">dedicated page</a>.</p>

<p>Hope you'll find this useful, feel free to contribute your own scripts (via pull requests, for example :)</p>
