    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now that I have a nice box prototype made of cardboard, it's time to make actual blueprints and size calculations, refining the prototype with some ideas.</p>

<p>If you're new here, and wish to read the whole project, start on <a href="/blog/2013/07/15/spitfire-project-day-number-1/">day #1 of this project</a>.</p>

<h2>The blueprints</h2>

<p>As I said above, I made some arrangements to the original prototype. For example, I found a way to hide hinges. Apart from some screws, not too much clutter should be visible from the outside.</p>

<h2>Size calculations</h2>

<p>I started on a base control panel size of 20cm width and 15cm height. But to be honest, I don't really know the required size... At least I have the formulas.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<pre><code>height inside = 3cm
panel width = 20cm
panel height = 15cm
panel horizontal border = 2cm
panel vertical border = 3cm
panel angle = pi / 9 
wood thickness = 0.5cm
stiffener thickness = 1.5cm
saw width = 0.1cm
</code></pre>

<h3>Intermediary products and functions</h3>

<pre><code>surface = width * height

panel climb = sin(panel angle) * panel height
            =&gt; 5.13cm

base width = panel width
base height = cos(panel angle) * panel height
           =&gt; 14.1cm

front height = height inside + wood thickness
back height = front height + panel climb

climb on back stiffener = tan(panel angle) * stiffener thickness
                        =&gt; 0.55cm

max(x, y) = if x &gt; y then x else y
min(x, y) = if x &lt; y then x else y
</code></pre>

<h3>Resulting measurements</h3>

<p>Part 1: back vertical stiffener</p>

<pre><code>p1 length = back height - climb on back stiffener - wood thickness
          =&gt; 7.58cm
</code></pre>

<p>Part 2: front vertical stiffener</p>

<pre><code>p2 length = front height - wood thickness
          =&gt; 3cm
</code></pre>

<p>Part 3: side stiffener</p>

<pre><code>p3 length = base height - 2 * (stiffener thickness + wood thickness)
          =&gt; 10.1cm
</code></pre>

<p>Part 4: back stiffener</p>

<pre><code>p4 length = base width - 2 * (stiffener thickness + wood thickness)
          =&gt; 16cm
</code></pre>

<p>Part 5: side board</p>

<pre><code>p5 width = base height
         =&gt; 14.1cm
p5 front height = front height + wood thickness
                =&gt; 4cm
p5 back height = height inside + panel climb + wood thickness
               =&gt; 8.63cm
</code></pre>

<p>PartÂ 6: back board</p>

<pre><code>p6 width = base width - 2 * wood thickness
         =&gt; 19cm
p6 height = back height
          =&gt; 8.63cm
</code></pre>

<p>Part 7: front board</p>

<pre><code>p7 width = base width - 2 * wood thickness
         =&gt; 19cm
p7 height = front height
          =&gt; 3.5cm
</code></pre>

<p>Part 9: bottom board</p>

<pre><code>p9 width = base width - 2 * wood thickness
         =&gt; 19cm
p9 height = base height - 2 * wood thickness
          =&gt; 13.1cm
</code></pre>

<p>Part 10: panel</p>

<pre><code>p10 width = panel width + 2 * panel horizontal border
          =&gt; 24cm
p10 height = panel height + 2 * panel vertical border
           =&gt; 21cm
</code></pre>

<p>Board surface</p>

<pre><code>p5 height diff = p5 back height - p5 front height
               =&gt; 4.63cm

p5 surface = p5 width * p5 front height + (p5 width * p5 height diff) / 2
           =&gt; 89.01cm^2

p6 surface = p6 width * p6 height
p7 surface = p7 width * p7 height
p9 surface = p9 width * p9 height
p10 surface = p10 width * p10 height
</code></pre>

<p>Totals &amp; required material</p>

<pre><code>total stiffener length = p1 length + p2 length + p3 length + p4 length + 3 * saw width
                       =&gt; 36.98cm

total board surface = p5 surface + p6 surface + p7 surface + p9 surface + p10 surface
                    =&gt; 1072.3cm^2


base board required width = max(base width/cm, min(p10 width/cm, p10 height/cm)) * cm
                          =&gt; 21cm
base board required height = p5 front height + p5 back height # the two side plates
                           + p6 height + p7 height + p9 height
                           + max(p10 width/cm, p10 height/cm) * cm
                           + 5 * saw width
                           =&gt; 62.36cm
</code></pre>

<p>If you find something wrong in here, please tell me :)</p>

<h2>Find it on github</h2>

<p>As usual, all of this can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/aspyct/spitfire">github repository of the project</a>. Please note that you'll need <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle/">Omnigraffle</a> to open the blueprints. The calculations markdown file can be opened with <a href="http://calca.io/">Calca</a> for better results.</p>

<h2>To be continued</h2>

<p>The arduino leonardo I needed for this project recently arrived. Next time we'll try to interface that with War Thunder :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For this controller, I need a box. I want it to be classy, sober, and a bit old-school. The only real requirement is that it has to provide an easy access to electronics in case something goes wrong. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy's_law">Murphy's law</a>, you know...</p>

<p>Some of you may arrive out of the blue here. So have a look at the <a href="/blog/2013/07/15/spitfire-project-day-number-1/">previous article, day #1</a>.</p>

<p>So I tear apart my joystick box, cardboard stuff, and built a small control box with it. Or rather a prototype of that box to be.</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>

<p>With a few simple tools like swiss army knife, a set square, a pen and some tape, I started destroying one box and building the other :) This is the bottom that you can see here: (the tape roll ran away during the picture)</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/media/spitfire/box_prototype1.jpg" title="'A few tools and some cardboard'" ></p>

<h2>Building the box</h2>

<p>Then I quickly added the top as well as some switches and LEDs. I think it looks nice already, I'm gonna love it!</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/media/spitfire/box_prototype4.jpg" title="'After adding the top and some switches'" ></p>

<p>After some fiddling around, I decided to go for a rear opening. With the cardboard, it works fine, but the wooden box will require hinges. And it's probably a bad idea to put hinges in front, I might well hurt myself on this...</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/media/spitfire/box_prototype2.jpg" title="'Rear opening system'" ></p>

<p>With the sides, and the arduino inside for the show...</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/media/spitfire/box_prototype3.jpg" title="'The arduino inside'" ></p>

<h2>Finished prototype</h2>

<p>So that's it. Not really impressive, eh? But this gives a good idea of the expected final shape, and it helped me think about some important stuff like hinge position, cable management etc. A few hours work, little to no cost for so many saved hours and material later :)</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/media/spitfire/box_prototype5.jpg" title="'The finished prototype'" ></p>

<p>On top of it is the first list of the controls I want on this box. More on that later :)</p>
